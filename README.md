### This project will soon become the sucessor of Mastoget, however an incident regarding Github and Vercel had delayed the process which can be tracked on https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/d0nm3xcdc5jw. Once this project is online "The Mastoget Organization" will begin its shutdown and will redirect all of its endpoints to Mastofetch.

## üåê Vision of Mastofetch
To make the decentralized social web more accessible, discoverable, and transparent by providing a seamless, ethical window into the diverse voices of the Fediverse.

## üöÄ Mission of Mastofetch
Mastofetch aims to empower developers, researchers, and curious users by delivering an open-source, privacy-conscious tool that fetches and organizes public Mastodon content across instances‚Äîpromoting interoperability, openness, and user empowerment in the evolving world of federated networks.

## Short History of Mastofetch
‚Ä¢During the early years of Mastoget, it was slow, because it loads every post it fetches before showing to the user. And it happens that 12 seperate renderers are created to avoid exceeding the limits of each endpoints.
<br><br>
‚Ä¢On May 25, 2025, "TheDoggyBrad Software Labs" fixed the major problem with Mastoget, which is slow loading as it loads everything before it shows the page to the user with lazyload.<br>
It was seen that the 12 seperate load balancing renderers of Mastoget are no longer needed.
<br><br>
‚Ä¢On May 26, 2025, it was decided that instead of messing up with the super weird configuration of Mastoget, it was retired and replaced by Mastofetch.
